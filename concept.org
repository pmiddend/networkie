* FRP

  - Somehow wrap Sockets in FRP (Sodium?)
  - How?
    - Given "Event FrpSocket"
      - Can we create a list of clients directly, with an optional
        name (initially maybe)?
	- Index by Handle?
      - We can write an event that fires if an FrpSocket sends its name
	- Given the socketevent, we can map to SentData
	  - No we can't, we can only map from "Event FrpSocket" to
            "Event (Event a))", and then we can't go back.
	  - Can we somehow get to "Behavior (Event a))", from which we
            could derive "Event a" again using switch?
	  - Or even "Behavior (Behavior a))"
	  - Event -> Behavior would be "hold", but that takes a
            default value.
	  - Use the Handle as a key into a Socket Map, add name as Maybe?
	- Then we can filter to name received
	- How do we drag along the socket?
      - Then we'd like to update a "Map Name Socket"
	- How?
	- The Map is definitely a Behavior, and it's empty in the beginning
	- Map to the "Map -> Map" function (insert), then do accum
      - We can write an event that fires if an FrpSocket disconnects
      - Then we'd like to update the map, too
      - Can we write an event that fires if a _named_ FrpSocket writes data?
      - How do we distribute that to the clients?

* Planning
  - First phase, "stupid" client, server does everything
    - Client
      - Gets server address/port from command line, tries to connect
      - Upon connection, sends "hello" package with his/her name
      - Server then continuously sends game data, which is then rendered
      - Client sends input data to server
    - Server
      - Waits for exactly two clients, receiving their name in the "hello" package
      - Upon receiving two clients, sends the world to both
      - Upon receiving input events, updates game and sends it back to clients
* Networking
  - Serialization either with "derive generic" and the "binary"
    package or simply show/read for now.
  - Server waits for two connections, after that just for network
    packages (purely reactive, so to speak).
  - The client waits for keyboard input or network input.
  - Haskell networking lacks "select" for synchronous I/O
    multiplexing. How do we cope?
    - Server doesn't need this, it only reacts to input (and maybe
      does something on a timeout)
    - Client needs to re-render on network input, send a signal on
      keyboard input.
      - Can we do this with threads?
	- We might do it with [[http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929/ch10.html#sec_tchan][STM]]
	- Terminal.hs from SneakyBeaky provides "getCharEvent" which
          blocks until a char is read.
	- I imagine a function of type =IO ByteString= which also blocks and
          returns the read byte (or structure)
	- Using =waitEither= to get either character or network input
